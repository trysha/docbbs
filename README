Quick HOWTO:

 - untar the src (duh!)
 - make bbs user and home dir
 - mkdirs:
	bin/
	core/
	core/bbs/
	core/bbsqueued/
	data/
	etc/
	etc/who/
	help/
	message/
	message/desc/
	var/

 - edit bbs.h
 - run setup program, compile the BBS, and set the binary in ~/bin.

Please read the TODO file for known issues.

On solaris, set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=100 in /etc/system seems to control
number of possible users.
